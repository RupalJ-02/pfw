## Projects

### LSTM Sentiment Analysis on Blinkit, Zepto, and Jiomart Reviews

Implemented sentiment analysis one-commerce customer reviews from Blinkit , Zepto and Jiomart using an LSTM-based neural network, achieving 0.9 F1-score and accuracy of 89%.
Designed and executed a pipeline including data preprocessing, tokenization, word embeddings and data visualization to validate the effectiveness of deep learning in NLP tasks.

### Parkinson’s Disease detection using SVM Classifier

Built a SVM classifier model to detect the Parkinson’s disease. UCI Parkinson’s dataset containing 195
records from 31 people, 23 of which have Parkinson’s disease was used. Utilized libraries such as scikitlearn,
numpy, pandas, and xgboost and achieved an accuracy of 94.87%.
